# Project Name
Rental Bike sharing Project
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

## General Information
We are going to build this project with following business goals
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
To Build the model we will follow below mentioned steps -
1. Reading and understanding the data
2. Visualizing the data
3. Data preparation
4. Splitting the data into tranining and test datasets.
5. Feature scaling
6. Building the model
7. Residual analysis of the train data
8. Making predictions using the final model
9. Model Evaluation


## Conclusions
We came up with following conclusions after building the final model
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
